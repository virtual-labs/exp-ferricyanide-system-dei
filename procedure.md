### Procedure:

<br>
●	Prepare four solutions of potassium ferricyanide solutions having concentrations of 0.01 mM,  0.1 mM, 1 mM, and 10 mM.
<br>
●	Prepare the solutions in a 100 ml volumetric flask.
<br>
●	Take 10µl of each solution using a micropipette and place it on a screen-printed electrode.
<br>
●	Analyze the graph obtained from all four solutions.
<br>
●	The graph represents the impedance responses of different concentrations of K<sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub> in the Nyquist format.
