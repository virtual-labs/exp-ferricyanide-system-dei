### Procedure:

<br>
●	Prepare four solutions of potassium ferricyanide solutions having concentrations of 0.01 mM,  0.1 mM, 1 mM, and 10 mM.
<br>
●	Prepare the solutions in a 100 ml volumetric flask.
<br>
●	Take 10µl of each solution using a micropipette and place it on a screen-printed electrode.
<br>
●	Analyze the graph obtained from all four solutions.
<br>
●	The graph represents the impedance responses of different concentrations of K<sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub> in the Nyquist format.
<br>
### Calculations:
<br>
●	Prepare 0.01mM of potassium ferricyanide solution <br>
Required concentration = 0.01 mM = 1 × 10⁻⁵ M <br>
Molecular weight of K₃[Fe(CN)₆] = 329.24 g mol⁻¹  <br>
Volume of solution = 100 mL = 0.1 L <br>
Mass=M×V×Molecular weight <br>
=(1×10−5)×0.1×329.24 <br>
=0.000329 gm <br>

●	Prepare 0.1mM of potassium ferricyanide solution <br>
Required concentration = 0.1 mM = 1 × 10-4 M <br>
Molecular weight of K₃[Fe(CN)₆] = 329.24 g mol⁻¹ <br>
Volume of solution = 100 mL = 0.1 L <br>
Mass=M×V×Molecular weight <br>
=(1×10−4)×0.1×329.24 <br>
=0.00329 gm <br>
